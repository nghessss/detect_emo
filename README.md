# Emotion Detection Application using Deep Learning Neural Network
## Overview
This application harnesses the power of deep learning techniques to discern the emotions of "positive," "negative," and "neutral" from input sentences. By leveraging neural network architectures, it delves into the intricate patterns of textual data, aiming to achieve higher accuracy in sentiment analysis. The integration of deep learning methodologies enhances the system's ability to grasp nuanced emotional expressions within the text.

## Features
Emotion Detection: The application accurately identifies whether a given sentence conveys a "positive," "negative," or "neutral" emotion.

* Neural Network Model: Employs deep learning neural network architectures for robust sentiment analysis.
* Training: The model is trained on labeled datasets to learn the complex relationships between words and emotions.
* View Results: Users can access predicted sentiments ("positive," "negative," or "neutral") along with confidence scores indicating the certainty of each prediction.
Accuracy
Precision: Significantly improved, achieving an accuracy of 74.5% after training with deep learning neural networks.
